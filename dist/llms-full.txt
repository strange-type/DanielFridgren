We like to think of ourselves as the ones doing the thinking, choosing, deciding. But in complex systems - whether minds, hives, or societies - the agency rarely sit in the center. And yet we continue to imagine a single mind, a single will, a single point of control.

The most obvious human reaction to complexity so far is to break down a problem into smaller pieces. Come up with lists of all tasks that needs to be done, order the tasks, and then direct task completion from a locus of control.

This centralized command blueprint has been the main approach in most human endeavors for centuries, if not longer. By far not the sole reason for the fall of nations such as the former Soviet Union. But this blueprint didn’t help. Like we tech bros like to say: It doesn’t scale.

There’s a deeper pattern here: our assumption that intelligence requires centralized control.

The centralized command blueprint is our current, persistent metaphor for how the brain works. I’m crazy enough to view things otherwise, so maybe you should stop reading now. My view is that intelligence does not need brains. And this text is really a short story about letting go of the myth of a single center in our organizations, our minds, and even our civilizations.

I generally dislike definitions of intelligence. They limit, narrow down. But there is something to Marvin Minskys way of defining this property that opens up instead. According to him, intelligence is something that emerges from a “loosely-knitted league of almost separate agencies with almost independent goals.”

And like anyone who has been in enough hours of therapy knows - the brain is no monopoly. It can rather be a harsh ecology, where competition breeds emergent cooperation. Or at least thats what you want as the outcome from it. Embrace and accept yourself just as you are. A never ending endeavor as it feels to me. No! “I” am in control!

What’s striking is how this pattern repeats at every scale. The way our inner agencies negotiate is not so different from how larger collectives find their coherence. If this sounds abstract, look at one of the clearest examples we have: an ant hive.

In an ant hive, who is in control? No single ant have the full perspective of the hive. For what we know, they may argue amongst themselves about whether they have free will. In my humble opinion, they are free agents. But also governed by something larger. The hive has agency. A kind of will. How does the hive choose what to do? We sometimes call it distributed governance, or emergent behavior.

The hive isn’t unique. Every complex collective generates patterns of behavior that exceed what any individual can perceive or intend. And so, in every complex collective - may it be a collective of ants, or a global human society - these emergent willpowers emerge. Larger than individuals and impossible to fully understand by means of rational thinking.

This is where things get uncomfortable: These forces seem to have intent, agenda - an intelligence of sorts. In the ant hive, forces emerge, acting like an invisible hand controlled by no single ant. I’d like to frame this as “the spirits of the hive”, rather than “hive mind”, because I suggest there are multitudes here.

Humanity very recently stopped using the old words to describe these forces. They were names of old gods and other entities. Angels, daemons, egregores. We also started to believe we are entitled to full control. That we can use rationality and science for this. But there has always been a dialectic interchange between us and these emergent forces.

It is time for us to rediscover and understand these forces again. Some people brush upon it when dealing with complexity theory, but most of us don’t see these forces for what they truly are, and we still grasp for ways to interact with them.

Maybe rediscovery isn’t about reviving old gods, but about recovering our ability to notice the agencies that move through us. They’ve never left. We simply stopped speaking their names.

# On Culture And Adaptability

Contrary to some popular narratives, I’d argue that humanity’s most powerful adaptive capacity is not technology, but culture. More precisely: _cultural malleability_.

Technology amplifies what a society is already capable of. Culture determines whether a society can change what it is capable of in the first place. It shapes what we consider normal, possible, and desirable, and therefore how we respond when circumstances change.

Every generation grows up immersed in a particular cultural blend. The one children inherit today - shaped by consumer culture, schooling and media - is very unique, and has been around for just a brief amount of time. It carries assumptions about progress, work, success and the future which would have felt alien to most people who lived before us.

Children in the past did not grow up with the trepidation that humans would destroy earth and consider moving to Mars - or that Large Language Models would determine their livelihoods. They lived inside different narratives, many of which we would now find strange or even unthinkable. Future generations will almost certainly view our own assumptions the same way.

The difficulty with culture is not that it changes, but that it rarely feels like it can, from the inside

We become like the fish in David Foster Wallace’s [This Is Water](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/), surrounded by assumptions so familiar they disappear from view.

Our ideas about the world, about the systems we create, about our values, about what is deemed as success - all these ideas tend to surround us completely, and affect our thoughts and our decisions. But they are also malleable and constantly in flux.

We can change it all. And so we do. Sometimes deliberately.

Cultural change is not just something that happens to us. At times, it is something societies attempt deliberately. And when they do, the process is rarely clean or linear. It is marked by uncertainty, multiple interpretations, and a prolonged period where old explanations no longer work but new ones have not yet taken shape.

Navigating this requires specific capacities: the ability to stay with open questions, to examine taken-for-granted assumptions, and to explore possibilities without prematurely collapsing them into solutions.

These are not uniquely professional skills. They are civic ones, necessary wherever organizations or institutions are being reshaped.

Design thinking, at its best, is a formalised practice of exactly this kind of work. Not the polishing of interfaces, but the disciplined act of probing, staying in uncertainty and exploration of what could exist - but doesn’t yet.

Many of today’s challenges are not technical problems waiting for better tools, but cultural ones, rooted in values, assumptions and ways of thinking that no longer fit the conditions they operate within.

The ability to notice this, to question assumptions without immediately replacing them, and to collectively explore alternatives is becoming increasingly important. It is slow work. Often uncomfortable. And difficult to optimise.

But it is also the work that allows societies to adapt without tearing themselves apart. And it may be one of the most valuable capacities we can continue to cultivate.

Why do we so often shape technology in such a different way compared to how nature works? One key to understand this is to see how technology embodies the dominant ideas and metaphors of its time. The structures we build not only reflects what we are capable of, but how we imagine the world, and our place within it.

Living systems operate through a very different set of principles. Life creates structures of equilibrium not through rigid control, but through constant, stochastic adaptation at the edges.

It is non-linear, self-correcting and there is no clear locus of control. From this complexity agency and intent emerge at multiple levels.

Consider a fungal mycelium. At one level, its growing tips act independently when exploring their surroundings in search for nutrients. At another level the network behaves like a swarm, activity being orchestrated without any central command centre. And mycelium, just like neural tissue, is knitted together into a connectome - a web of relationships so interconnected that it cannot be meaningfully decomposed into isolated parts.

These patterns are not unique to fungi, but recur across ecosystems and within bodies. They suggest a pattern in which intelligence, resilience, and coordination emerge from relationships rather than central command.

Modern technological systems, by contrast, have largely been shaped by a different historical idea. Software projects and technical infrastructures tend to be organised around metaphors of hierarchy, optimisation, and control. They are engineered to be predictable and governable. Not because technology must work this way, but because these metaphors have dominated industrial and post-industrial thinking for centuries.

These metaphors have deep roots: in Enlightenment rationalism, in industrial production and in the belief that complex systems function best when broken down, mastered, and directed from above. When applied to machines, this worldview has produced extraordinary efficiencies. At the expense of fragility.

The issue here is not nature versus technology. It is one set of metaphors versus another.

What would it mean to build technology from a relational stance? from principles such as interconnectedness, reciprocity, and mutual adaptation? This would not mean copying nature literally, nor romanticising biological systems. It would mean taking seriously the idea of emergence.

Speculative projects have explored this shift before. Ant Farm’s [Dolphin Embassy](http://hiddenarchitecture.net/dolphin-embassy/) imagined a space where human researchers and cetaceans would meet and learn to speak with one another on equal terms. The goal was not to attempt to teach dolphins human language, or vice versa, but to create the foundation for a relational process, in an environment that was equal for all agents.

The proposal was satirical, but its critique was precise: our technologies often assume our vantage point, and to some extent our dominance, as a starting point, rather than relationship.

A similar intuition appears in [The Overstory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Overstory), where Neelay Mehta grows disillusioned with games built around mastery and control. He begins to imagine systems that learn the way forests work: distributed, adaptive, and responsive to their surroundings. In the end, his work opens up a communication channel with our surroundings that reveals nonhuman nature as the overstory, rather than the opposite as it so often is in the anthropocentric view.

Technology, in this sense, carries forward the metaphors we inherit about agency, intelligence, and worth. For centuries, those metaphors have been shaped by human exceptionalism: the belief that humans stand apart from, and above, the systems they inhabit.

As long as this belief remains unexamined, our technologies will continue to reproduce it. If we want to build systems that are resilient rather than brittle, adaptive rather than extractive, we may need to question not just how our technologies work, but the metaphors that give them form, and the assumptions on which they rest.

I’ve got three children. In one sense they are the core of my investment portfolio. I invest a lot of time, attention, money and care in them.

From a business perspective, they are all terrible investments.

There will be no hockey sticks. No 100x returns. No compounding returns. No credible path to scale. Because my kids won’t scale the way a standard business would.

And I don’t want nor expect scalable returns. Whatever comes out of this investment will not be measurable in quarterly reports, and if things go well, I won’t even be around to see its full effects.

The most important things in life doesn’t scale.

Scalability is a product of a rational, production-oriented worldview shaped by assumptions of infinite resources, extraction, and optimisation. It asks how we can grow more, how value can be multiplied, and how effort can be leveraged, all without considering what is lost in this quest for more.

But more of what?

What truly matters cannot scale.

Yet, scalability is of major importance for investors. Often celebrated in technology and business contexts as a way to maximize efficiency and impact. But what kind of impact?

“We only look for scalable solutions for this problem.”

“If we can standardize this, the TAM will be huge.”

“The network effects here gives financial leverage.”

Consider for a moment what we loose when we scale.

Depth: Automated customer service may be scalable, but often the experience is subpar to talking with a real human.

Variation: Scalable solutions tend to flatten out local and cultural variation. Homogeneity is often a result of the hunt for scalability.

Robustness: What’s scalable in terms of human enterprises is often centralized and with single points of failure - Fragile.

These losses are not accidental, but structural. Scalability favours short feedback loops and repeatability. Value which unfolds slowly, that is distributed across many people, or resists standardisation becomes hard to justify within dominant investment models. The returns are delayed, indirect, and difficult to attribute. As a result, they fall outside what markets are well-equipped to fund, even when they are foundational to everything that follows.

There is a vast number of non-scalable investments out there with great payoff. By funding and nurturing what’s not scalable, we gain in many important areas. Some of which are antifragility, depth and variability.

But funding that which doesn’t scale has mostly been left to countries—and to a smaller extent charities and NGOs.

I believe we need to revisit this strategy.

Beneath the corporate and market layers sits a more foundational layer: the set of non-scalable investments that make societies viable in the first place. It includes care, education, trust, social cohesion and localized knowledge. This layer does not compound neatly, cannot be easily leveraged, and resists standardisation. Its value is systemic rather than transactional. Like externalised costs, it is rarely accounted for, nor visible on balance sheets. Yet everything above it depends on its continued health.

Is there a systemic risk in ignoring the foundational layer that markets quietly depend on? With very few exceptions, corporations show little sustained interest in maintaining it. One notable counterexample is the Mondragon Corporation, a federation of worker cooperatives built around long-term employment, shared ownership, and deep local embedding. Its structure makes it harder to extract value quickly, but better suited to preserving social continuity over time. The fact that Mondragon stands out so clearly says less about its uniqueness than about how rare such priorities have become in mainstream corporate life.

If the foundational layer erodes, the consequences won’t arrive as a single collapse, but as a gradual loss of resilience: institutions that work less well, that feel brittle, and organisations that struggle to operate without constantly firefighting. Corporations already rely on this layer, on educated people, functioning communities, and a baseline of trust - yet largely treat it as someone else’s responsibility.

Reinvesting in the non-scalable does not mean abandoning efficiency or scale where they make sense. It means recognising their limits. Some forms of value require proximity, patience, and care. They grow through continuity rather than acceleration. If we continue to underinvest in these foundations, we shouldn’t be surprised when the systems built on top of them start to wobble.

# UX for next-generation medical devices
> How can iterative prototyping reveal the right interaction model for next-generation dialysis machines?

Baxter

About

At Baxter, I worked on the interaction model for a next-generation dialysis machine, collaborating closely with clinical experts to define how the device should behave in real treatment scenarios. The work unfolded through a series of exploratory prototypes: three intentionally different interpretations of how critical information, system status, user actions, and alarms could coexist in a high-stakes clinical environment without competing for attention.

My responsibility spanned ideation, UX, and UI design. Early in the project, much of the effort focused on understanding the workflow of dialysis from a clinician’s perspective—how they navigate setup and priming, troubleshooting, monitoring, and end-of-treatment routines, often while handling multiple patients or responding to unexpected events. These observations informed the core interaction principles: clarity under pressure, predictable system behavior, and the ability to surface urgent information instantly without obscuring essential context.

Prototyping became the main vehicle for exploration and alignment. We built and tested interactive scenarios to evaluate how different layouts, interaction patterns, and alarm hierarchies affected clinicians’ ability to understand machine state at a glance. Each prototype took a distinct stance: one prioritized visual hierarchy and spatial grouping, another emphasized temporal sequencing and guided actions. The third explored adaptive interfaces that shifted according to treatment phase. This divergence helped us identify which design principles consistently improved safety and operator confidence.

The project gave me practical insight into the cognitive demands, time pressure, and regulatory constraints that define interaction design in acute-care environments. It sharpened my ability to design for clarity in highly technical contexts, where the cost of confusion is high and the interface is a critical part of clinical safety.

# Designing future-focused energy experiences
> How do you design a coherent smart-home interaction model that unifies energy insights, device control, and security into one ecosystem?

E.ON

About

During several consecutive projects at E.ON, I worked across both strategic and hands-on layers to help shape the user experience for their emerging smart-home platform. Across four initiatives over multiple years at TOPP, my role shifted depending on the maturity of the work: from early-stage framing and concept development to detailed design and implementation support.

The exploration covered a wide spectrum of domains—energy intelligence, ambient device control, lighting, and home security. Early in the collaboration, much of the work focused on understanding how these domains could coexist in a single, coherent ecosystem rather than as a collection of disconnected features. This meant identifying the right mental models for homeowners, defining the boundaries of automation, and articulating where manual control should remain simple and transparent.

One significant part of the work was mapping and designing every layer of the system: onboarding flows, configuration pathways, device setup patterns, daily routines, notification models and edge-case scenarios.

Prototyping played a central role. We built interactive simulations to test how energy insights, control interfaces, and security signals could coexist on the same surfaces without overwhelming the user. These prototypes were used continuously: to validate the product direction with stakeholders, to align engineering and design teams, and to uncover subtle usability challenges that wouldn’t show up in static wireframes.

In the later stages, I supported internally at E.ON during implementation. This involved translating concepts into final deliverables, I produced detailed interaction and UI designs, clarified edge cases, and reviewed builds to ensure coherence in the final product.

Overall, the work was about shaping not just individual features, but the underlying logic of a smart-home ecosystem.

# Refining digital healthcare experiences
> How do you design healthcare journeys that stay clinically precise while remaining calm, clear, and usable for real patients?

Min Doktor

About

I joined Min Doktor to help refine the core experience across both patient and caregiver touchpoints. The work centered on translating clinical intent into clear, safe user flows: triage, consultation, follow-up, while navigating tight regulatory constraints and the very practical realities of patient behaviour. Much of the challenge was about creating clarity in moments where users are stressed, uncertain, or making decisions with medical consequences, and ensuring the interface supported the underlying clinical protocols.

One highlight was a research initiative that followed Min Doktor’s acquisition of Minutkliniken. I discovered that nurses were frequently becoming a bottleneck in the patient flow. By analysing their workload, we identified opportunities to gather essential information before the consultation. One solution was a self-check-in kiosk for use in the clinic, enabling patients to confirm their visit and update their details on arrival. Another was encouraging patients to fill out forms and provide relevant medical history in the app ahead of time, which reduced the administrative load on nurses.

Working in this space meant constantly balancing precision with usability: interpreting clinical guidelines, understanding operational routines, and shaping interactions that met strict compliance requirements without becoming rigid or opaque. It required close collaboration with clinicians, product managers, and engineers to ensure that the experience was not just functional, but trustworthy and scalable across different care pathways.

All in all, the role deepened my grasp of healthcare’s structural complexity, including the interplay between providers, patients, legislation, and economic incentives. It revealed how design decisions sit within a dense ecosystem of clinical safety, reimbursement models, and organisational workflow.

# Democratizing Design and UxR Work
> How can lightweight methods unlock better decisions, faster alignment, and a more self-sufficient organisation?

Refined

About

During my years at Refined, I hired, coached and developed talent to raise the overall design maturity. Beyond team leadership, I facilitated cross-functional workshops and optimized product development processes.

I developed a Product Discovery playbook that enabled not just designers but entire cross-functional teams to surface user insights and make grounded product decisions. The goal wasn’t to impose a rigid methodology, but to offer a lightweight, modular toolkit that teams could use on their own terms. It created a shared way of working that reduced dependency on the design department, while raising the overall quality of discovery work, effectively democratizing research and making teams more self-sufficient.

I also facilitated design sprints to build alignment and momentum around pivotal product improvements, including a major refresh of the site builder experience. These sprints became a structured way to cut through ambiguity, bring stakeholders into the problem space, and rapidly test assumptions before committing effort. The work helped teams converge on clear direction while still preserving the exploratory spirit needed to rethink a complex, widely-used product area.

> Daniel brings this sort of holistic expertise, with a focus on design, to any and all projects that he's involved in. I've experienced him to be an exceptionally kind, empathetic, and open individual - all qualities that I value highly in and out of the workplace.\
> \
> _- Raj Sehmi, Customer Success Lead at Refined_

This work refined (pun intended) my understanding of how organisations may adopt new practices: the most effective tools are those that expand capability without increasing process weight. I also saw how shared discovery habits can shift team culture-making insights more accessible, decisions more transparent and more fluid across roles.
