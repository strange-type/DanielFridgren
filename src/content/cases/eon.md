During several consecutive projects at E.ON, I worked across both strategic and hands-on layers to help shape the user experience for their emerging smart-home platform. Across four initiatives over multiple years at TOPP, my role shifted depending on the maturity of the work: from early-stage framing and concept development to detailed design and implementation support.

The exploration covered a wide spectrum of domains—energy intelligence, ambient device control, lighting, and home security. Early in the collaboration, much of the work focused on understanding how these domains could coexist in a single, coherent ecosystem rather than as a collection of disconnected features. This meant identifying the right mental models for homeowners, defining the boundaries of automation, and articulating where manual control should remain simple and transparent.

One significant part of the work was mapping and designing every layer of the system: onboarding flows, configuration pathways, device setup patterns, daily routines, notification models and edge-case scenarios.

Prototyping played a central role. We built interactive simulations to test how energy insights, control interfaces, and security signals could coexist on the same surfaces without overwhelming the user. These prototypes were used continuously: to validate the product direction with stakeholders, to align engineering and design teams, and to uncover subtle usability challenges that wouldn't show up in static wireframes.

In the later stages, I supported internally at E.ON during implementation. This involved translating concepts into final deliverables, I produced detailed interaction and UI designs, clarified edge cases, and reviewed builds to ensure coherence in the final product.

Overall, the work was about shaping not just individual features, but the underlying logic of a smart-home ecosystem.
