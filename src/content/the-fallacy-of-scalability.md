I’ve got three children. In one sense they are the core of my investment portfolio. I invest a lot of time, attention, money and care in them.

From a business perspective, they are all terrible investments.

There will be no hockey sticks. No 100x returns. No compounding returns. No credible path to scale. Because my kids won’t scale the way a standard business would.

And I don’t want nor expect scalable returns. Whatever comes out of this investment will not be measurable in quarterly reports, and if things go well, I won’t even be around to see its full effects.

The most important things in life doesn’t scale.

Scalability is a product of a rational, production-oriented worldview shaped by assumptions of infinite resources, extraction, and optimisation. It asks how we can grow more, how value can be multiplied, and how effort can be leveraged, all without considering what is lost in this quest for more. 

But more of what?

What truly matters cannot scale.

Yet, scalability is of major importance for investors. Often celebrated in technology and business contexts as a way to maximize efficiency and impact. But what kind of impact?

"We only look for scalable solutions for this problem."

"If we can standardize this, the TAM will be huge.”

"The network effects here gives financial leverage."

Consider for a moment what we loose when we scale.

Depth: Automated customer service may be scalable, but often the experience is subpar to talking with a real human. 

Variation: Scalable solutions tend to flatten out local and cultural variation. Homogeneity is often a result of the hunt for scalability.

Robustness: What’s scalable in terms of human enterprises is often centralized and with single points of failure - Fragile.

These losses are not accidental, but structural. Scalability favours short feedback loops and repeatability. Value which unfolds slowly, that is distributed across many people, or resists standardisation becomes hard to justify within dominant investment models. The returns are  delayed, indirect, and difficult to attribute. As a result, they fall outside what markets are well-equipped to fund, even when they are foundational to everything that follows.

There is a vast number of non-scalable investments out there with great payoff. By funding and nurturing what’s not scalable, we gain in many important areas. Some of which are antifragility, depth and variability. 

But funding that which doesn’t scale has mostly been left to countries—and to a smaller extent charities and NGOs.

I believe we need to revisit this strategy.  

Beneath the corporate and market layers sits a more foundational layer: the set of non-scalable investments that make societies viable in the first place. It includes care, education, trust, social cohesion and localized knowledge. This layer does not compound neatly, cannot be easily leveraged, and resists standardisation. Its value is systemic rather than transactional. Like externalised costs, it is rarely accounted for, nor visible on balance sheets. Yet everything above it depends on its continued health.

Is there a systemic risk in ignoring the foundational layer that markets quietly depend on? With very few exceptions, corporations show little sustained interest in maintaining it. One notable counterexample is the Mondragon Corporation, a federation of worker cooperatives built around long-term employment, shared ownership, and deep local embedding. Its structure makes it harder to extract value quickly, but better suited to preserving social continuity over time. The fact that Mondragon stands out so clearly says less about its uniqueness than about how rare such priorities have become in mainstream corporate life.

If the foundational layer erodes, the consequences won’t arrive as a single collapse, but as a gradual loss of resilience: institutions that work less well, that feel brittle, and organisations that struggle to operate without constantly firefighting. Corporations already rely on this layer, on educated people, functioning communities, and a baseline of trust - yet largely treat it as someone else’s responsibility.

Reinvesting in the non-scalable does not mean abandoning efficiency or scale where they make sense. It means recognising their limits. Some forms of value require proximity, patience, and care. They grow through continuity rather than acceleration. If we continue to underinvest in these foundations, we shouldn’t be surprised when the systems built on top of them start to wobble.
