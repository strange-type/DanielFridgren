Contrary to some popular narratives, I’d argue that humanity’s most powerful adaptive capacity is not technology, but culture. More precisely: *cultural malleability*.

Technology amplifies what a society is already capable of. Culture determines whether a society can change what it is capable of in the first place. It shapes what we consider normal, possible, and desirable, and therefore how we respond when circumstances change.

Every generation grows up immersed in a particular cultural blend. The one children inherit today - shaped by consumer culture, schooling and media - is very unique, and has been around for just a brief amount of time. It carries assumptions about progress, work, success and the future which would have felt alien to most people who lived before us.

Children in the past did not grow up with the trepidation that humans would destroy earth and consider moving to Mars - or that Large Language Models would determine their livelihoods. They lived inside different narratives, many of which we would now find strange or even unthinkable. Future generations will almost certainly view our own assumptions the same way.

The difficulty with culture is not that it changes, but that it rarely feels like it can, from the inside

We become like the fish in David Foster Wallace's <a href="https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Water</a>, surrounded by assumptions so familiar they disappear from view.

Our ideas about the world, about the systems we create, about our values, about what is deemed as success - all these ideas tend to surround us completely, and affect our thoughts and our decisions. But they are also malleable and constantly in flux.

We can change it all. And so we do. Sometimes deliberately.

Cultural change is not just something that happens to us. At times, it is something societies attempt deliberately. And when they do, the process is rarely clean or linear. It is marked by uncertainty, multiple  interpretations, and a prolonged period where old explanations no longer work but new ones have not yet taken shape.

Navigating this requires specific capacities: the ability to stay with open questions, to examine taken-for-granted assumptions, and to explore possibilities without prematurely collapsing them into solutions.

These are not uniquely professional skills. They are civic ones, necessary wherever organizations or institutions are being reshaped.

Design thinking, at its best, is a formalised practice of exactly this kind of work. Not the polishing of interfaces, but the disciplined act of probing, staying in uncertainty and exploration of what could exist - but doesn’t yet.

Many of today’s challenges are not technical problems waiting for better tools, but cultural ones, rooted in values, assumptions and ways of thinking that no longer fit the conditions they operate within.

The ability to notice this, to question assumptions without immediately replacing them, and to collectively explore alternatives is becoming increasingly important. It is slow work. Often uncomfortable. And difficult to optimise.

But it is also the work that allows societies to adapt without tearing themselves apart. And it may be one of the most valuable capacities we can continue to cultivate.
