Why do we so often shape technology in such a different way compared to how nature works? One key to understand this is to see how technology embodies the dominant ideas and metaphors of its time. The structures we build not only reflects what we are capable of, but how we imagine the world, and our place within it. 

Living systems operate through a very different set of principles. Life creates structures of equilibrium not through rigid control, but through constant, stochastic adaptation at the edges. 

It is non-linear, self-correcting and there is no clear locus of control. From this complexity agency and intent emerge at multiple levels. 
 
Consider a fungal mycelium. At one level, its growing tips act independently when exploring their surroundings in search for nutrients. At another level the network behaves like a swarm, activity being orchestrated without any central command centre. And mycelium, just like neural tissue, is knitted together into a connectome - a web of relationships so interconnected that it cannot be meaningfully decomposed into isolated parts.

These patterns are not unique to fungi, but recur across ecosystems and within bodies. They suggest a pattern in which intelligence, resilience, and coordination emerge from relationships rather than central command.

Modern technological systems, by contrast, have largely been shaped by a different historical idea. Software projects and technical infrastructures tend to be organised around metaphors of hierarchy, optimisation, and control. They are engineered to be predictable and governable. Not because technology must work this way, but because these metaphors have dominated industrial and post-industrial thinking for centuries.

These metaphors have deep roots: in Enlightenment rationalism, in industrial production and in the belief that complex systems function best when broken down, mastered, and directed from above. When applied to machines, this worldview has produced extraordinary efficiencies. At the expense of fragility.

The issue here is not nature versus technology. It is one set of metaphors versus another.

What would it mean to build technology from a relational stance? from principles such as interconnectedness, reciprocity, and mutual adaptation? This would not mean copying nature literally, nor romanticising biological systems. It would mean taking seriously the idea of emergence.

Speculative projects have explored this shift before. Ant Farm's [Dolphin Embassy](http://hiddenarchitecture.net/dolphin-embassy/) imagined a space where human researchers and cetaceans would meet and learn to speak with one another on equal terms. The goal was not to attempt to teach dolphins human language, or vice versa, but to create the foundation for a relational process, in an environment that was equal for all agents.

 The proposal was satirical, but its critique was precise: our technologies often assume our vantage point, and to some extent our dominance, as a starting point, rather than relationship.

A similar intuition appears in [The Overstory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Overstory), where Neelay Mehta grows disillusioned with games built around mastery and control. He begins to imagine systems that learn the way forests work: distributed, adaptive, and responsive to their surroundings. In the end, his work opens up a communication channel with our surroundings that reveals nonhuman nature as the overstory, rather than the opposite as it so often is in the anthropocentric view.

Technology, in this sense, carries forward the metaphors we inherit about agency, intelligence, and worth. For centuries, those metaphors have been shaped by human exceptionalism: the belief that humans stand apart from, and above, the systems they inhabit.

As long as this belief remains unexamined, our technologies will continue to reproduce it. If we want to build systems that are resilient rather than brittle, adaptive rather than extractive, we may need to question not just how our technologies work, but the metaphors that give them form, and the assumptions on which they rest.
