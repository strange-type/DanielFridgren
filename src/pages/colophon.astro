                        Traditionally, it records details about things like authorship,
                        materials, tools and place of creation. Here, it explains
                        how this website was made.
                        <Spacer size="xs" />
                        I designed and built the site myself. I chose a code-first
                        workflow to retain full control over structure and presentation.
                        The backbone is <a
                            href="https://astro.build"
                            target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a
                        >, chosen for its static-first model and restrained use
                        of client-side JavaScript. GitHub Copilot was used as a
                        coding assistant for routine tasks and small JavaScript
                        utilities. Design decisions, structure, and final
                        implementations remained mine. The interface is built
                        with plain HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript.
                        All blog posts and case material are written in Markdown
                        and structured using Astro Content Collections.

                        The visual system is defined through CSS design tokens. Spacing,
                        typography, colour, rhythm, and motion are expressed as variables
                        and reused consistently across the site, allowing the design
                        to be adjusted at a systemic level rather than page by page.
                        Typography is set using a fluid scale based on clamp(), adapting
                        across screen sizes with attention to line length, leading,
                        and contrast.

                        Motion is defined through <a

                        states, contrast, and semantic structure, are treated as
                        defaults rather than additions. The site is deployed as
