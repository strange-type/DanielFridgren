                        > is a text that documents how a work was produced.
                        Dating back to ancient manuscripts, it contains details about things like
                        materials, tools and place of creation. For a website, it explains
                        how it was made.

                        I designed and built the site myself. The codebase lives
                        in a private GitHub repository. I chose a code-first
                        workflow to retain full control over structure and
                        presentation. The backbone is <a
                            href="https://astro.build"
                            target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a
                        >, chosen for its static-first model and restrained use
                        of client-side JavaScript. The interface is built
                        with plain HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript. 
                        All blog posts and case material are written in Markdown
                        and structured using Astro Content Collections.

                        The visual system is defined through CSS design tokens. Spacing,
                        typography, colour, rhythm, and motion are expressed as variables
                        and reused consistently across the site, allowing the design
                        to be adjusted at a systemic level rather than page by page.
                        Typography is set using a fluid scale based on clamp(), adapting
                        across screen sizes with attention to line length, leading,
                        and contrast.
                        <Spacer size="xs" />
                        Motion is defined through <a
                            href="https://gsap.com/"
                            target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">GSAP</a
                        >, used sparingly and disabled for users who prefer
                        reduced motion. Accessibility considerations: focus
                        states, contrast, and semantic structure, are treated as
                        defaults rather than additions. The site is deployed as
                        a static build on <a
