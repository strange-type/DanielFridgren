                        The visual system is defined through custom CSS design tokens.
                        Spacing follows a t-shirt sizing convention, while typography,
                        color, and rhythm are expressed as CSS custom properties
                        and applied consistently across the site. This systemic approach
                        allows design adjustments at the token level rather than
                        page by page. Typography is set using a fluid scale, adapting
                        across screen sizes with attention to line length, leading,
                        and contrast. The typeface is TT Norms Pro Compact, loaded
                        locally in three weights (300, 400, 500) with italic variants.

                        states, contrast ratios, semantic HTML, and ARIA labels—are
                        treated as defaults rather than additions.

                        Contact form submissions are processed server-side using

                        (honeypot fields and minimum form fill times), then delivered
                        via <a

                        Overall a fun project, though perhaps a bit overengineered
                        for a personal portfolio.
