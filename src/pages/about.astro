        I'm an independent designer and consultant with a couple of decades of
        experience. My interests include design, cognition, emergence and
        complex adaptive systems - particularly where smaller scale behaviour
        gives rise to system-level patterns that no one explicitly designed.

        Based in Malmö, Sweden, I work across strategic and hands-on layers of
        design: from product discovery and service design to interface-level UX.
        My journey has taken me from pioneering work on the first version of
        Android at Google to leading design teams in dynamic startups and
        consulting for a diverse range of clients.

        the roles and contexts I've worked within:
