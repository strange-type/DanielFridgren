One key to understand this is to see how technology embodies the dominant ideas and metaphors of its time. The structures we build not only reflects what we are capable of, but how we imagine the world, and our place within it. \n\nLiving systems operate through a very different set of principles. Life creates structures of equilibrium not through rigid control, but through constant, stochastic adaptation at the edges. \n\nIt is non-linear, self-correcting and there is no clear locus of control. From this complexity agency and intent emerge at multiple levels. \n \nConsider a fungal mycelium. At one level, its growing tips act independently when exploring their surroundings in search for nutrients. At another level the network behaves like a swarm, activity being orchestrated without any central command centre. And mycelium, just like neural tissue, is knitted together into a connectome - a web of relationships so interconnected that it cannot be meaningfully decomposed into isolated parts.\n\nThese patterns are not unique to fungi, but recur across ecosystems and within bodies. They suggest a pattern in which intelligence, resilience, and coordination emerge from relationships rather than central command.\n\nModern technological systems, by contrast, have largely been shaped by a different historical idea.
